post order subtree ka mtlab to visiting the nodes through left tree , right subtree and root node.

this traversal method is often used in tree traversal method and evalutaing certain expressions.

Q)Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of the nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
 

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?







SOL->

class Solution:
    def postorderTraversal(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        res = []
        def pot(root):
            if root:
                pot(root.left)
                pot(root.right)
                res.append(root.val)
        pot(root)
        return res
